# SMPG
A Simple Multiplayer Pong Game

This is a pong clone written for the graphical programming language Processing (ver. 3.x).
It was created to better understand the processing.net library.

You can play on one machine with yourself, or within a LAN. To play with friends in other networks you'll most
likely have to set up a VPN (or do port forwarding for port 6878 if applicable).

HowTo: 
  - Make sure Processing is installed on all the machines you want to use for the game.
  - Open and start the server application on the host computer. 
  - Now open the client files and change the host ip variable accordingly:
      Host is on local computer: leave it as it is already (127.0.0.1)
      Host is in LAN: enter IP that is shown in Host window
      Host is in different network, has port forwarding: Enter public IPv4 address of host.
      Host is in different network, VPN: Enter virtual IP of host
 - You can also change the name of each player in the client files
 - Have fun! Control the game with w + s on clientside, use gui buttons to control serverside.
